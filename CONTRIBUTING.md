# Contribution
## Project
Before starting your contribution, please check the project's **backlog** and **issues**. This will give you an idea of what needs to be worked on or what needs help. Your contribution will be more effective if it aligns with the project's current needs.
## Pull Request
Before submitting a pull request, please ensure the following:

1. **Test Code**: Any test code within the project should be commented out. This includes, but is not limited to:
    - Code for adding items
    - Code for changing locations
    - Code within the `OnPlayerCreate`, `OnShopCreate`, and similar functions

2. **Notices**: Please leave a comment above any test code that you've commented out. This helps other contributors understand why the code is commented and when it might be useful to uncomment it.

By adhering to these guidelines, we can maintain a clean and efficient codebase for everyone. Thank you for your cooperation!

3. **Recognition**: If you make a pull request for one of the needed changes, work in progress, or an issue, you will be added to the contributors list and given permission to edit the backlog. This is way the project can stay more organized.
